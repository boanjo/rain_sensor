rain_sensor
===========
A tipping bucket 433MHz rain sensor compatible with Tellstick, Rfxcom etc.

The firmware is based on Brage SIP lite (an Arduino UNO like board with smaller footprint and less components that draw current). I have chosen to emulate the existing Oregon PCR800 tipping bucket protocol rather than to create a propertary one (for compatibility reasons mainly but it is also a pretty good protocol). 

The Hardware is a tipping bucket from Rainwise 111. It's pretty pricy but after have tried numerous cheaper solutions (including the Oregon PCR800) i have concluded that it is worth every penny!
